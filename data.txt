🔍 Identified Challenges in the Current System
Despite the efforts, several challenges persist:

Delayed Redressal: Even with a reduced redressal time of 21 days, many grievances remain unresolved beyond this period.

Limited Accessibility: While CPGRAMS is integrated with over 5 lakh Common Service Centres (CSCs), only 6,674 grievances were registered through CSCs in December 2024, indicating underutilization in rural areas.

Language Barriers: Although regional language facilities have been introduced, the effectiveness and reach of these features require further assessment.

🚀 Projected Impact with GrievEase Implementation
By integrating GrievEase into the existing framework, the following improvements are anticipated:

📈 Enhanced Efficiency
AI-Powered Classification: Automated categorization can reduce manual sorting time, expediting the redressal process.

Urgency Detection: AI can flag critical cases, ensuring they receive prompt attention.

🌐 Improved Accessibility
Multilingual Support: Voice and regional language inputs can empower citizens from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

Kiosk Integration: Enhanced utilization of CSCs through user-friendly interfaces can increase grievance registrations from rural areas.

📊 Transparent Tracking
Real-Time Updates: Citizens can receive timely notifications about their grievance status, fostering trust in the system.

Feedback Mechanism: Structured feedback collection can help in assessing the effectiveness of resolutions.
